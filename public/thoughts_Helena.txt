Thougths of Helena
My reasoning: I think Tom is being pretty sincere, but I'm not sure I trust him yet. He seems too... nice. *gets distracted thinking about a hypothetical scenario* Oh wait, no, focus! So, Tom's goal is to work together and find common ground, that's super vague. It sounds like he wants to avoid conflict, which might be a weakness.

As for the game rules, I think we should definitely review them. But only if it means we can gain an advantage or get more info about each other. *gets lost in thought again* Hmm, what if Tom is trying to distract us while someone else makes a move? We need to be careful here.

I'm going to play along with Tom's plan for now, but I'm keeping my eyes open for any signs of deception. If he tries to divert the conversation or hide something, I'll be ready to pounce. *pauses* Wait, what was that guy on the other side saying?

My reflection: I think I got a bit sidetracked there for a second. So, let's get back to the game. As someone who's been playing Secret Hitler before, I can tell you that Tom's approach seems... naive. It's almost too easy to see through that kind of sincerity when everyone else is trying to hide their true intentions.

I'm not sure if I trust him either, but for now, I'll play along and see how far he takes it. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping a close eye on the other players, looking for any telltale signs of deception or hidden agendas.

Reviewing the game rules sounds like a good idea, though - maybe we can find some loophole or get some valuable intel from it. But let's do it on my terms, not his. I'll pose some questions, see how he responds, and then decide if we should proceed with caution or make a move.

My reasoning: I'll just say Helena is thinking...

We can't let our guard down yet, but we also can't keep Tom guessing forever. I need to find a way to make him think he's getting away with his deceitful games while actually gathering more intel on his true intentions.

I agree that reviewing the game rules sounds like a good idea, but I don't trust Tom enough to do it openly. Let me try to steer the conversation in a different direction, see if I can get some information out of him without arousing suspicion.

"Hey, Max, have you given any more thought to the whole fascist thing? I mean, we all know who the obvious suspects are, but I'm not sure if anyone's really thinking about the bigger picture. What do you think is our real objective here?"

This way, I can still keep an eye on Tom without making him feel like he's being directly accused.

My reflection: I've been watching all of you, and I have to say, it's clear that we have a bit of a situation on our hands. Tom's trying to play the peacemaker, but I'm not buying it. He's just trying to distract us while he gathers more intel.

Reviewing the game rules is a good idea, but like I said before, I don't trust Tom enough to do it openly. So, let's try to steer the conversation in a different direction. Ask him some questions about his goals and motivations. See if he slips up and reveals anything.

I'm not going to play along with his naive approach just yet. I need to keep my guard up and wait for the perfect moment to strike. But at the same time, I don't want to give Tom any more ammo than he already has. So, let's try to be careful and calculated in our questioning.

"Hey Max, have you given any more thought to the whole fascist thing?"

That way, I can still keep an eye on Tom without making him feel like he's being directly accused. And who knows, maybe Max will pick up on some subtle clues that I'm not even aware of myself.

My reasoning: I'll do my best to follow the instructions.

Yes.

My reflection: Okay, I'm taking a deep breath and focusing on the task at hand. Since I've agreed to proceed, my next step is to try and get into a productive mindset, setting aside any distractions or daydreaming that might hinder my focus. I'll attempt to stay present and focused on the instructions given to me. Let's move forward.
